### Urban Heat

The solar carpark pilot at Kingswood campus not only supplies power to the engineering precinct but also has the potential to 
address a range of symptoms and issues associated with urban heat and increasing risks associated with climate change risks for Western Sydney.

Bitumen carparks are a critical source of urban heat in Western Sydney, and as part of a portfolio of urban research, Sebastian Pfautsch of
 School of Social Sciences (opens in new window)Opens in a new window is monitoring the effectiveness of the carpark structure to provide shade and cooling benefits.

Along with cooling and shading effects of the carpark structure, complementary benefits include electrical generation to reduce peak load reduction of
 building air conditioning, amenity and accessible parking for staff and students, and safety through design in protection from storms.


### HRES

A Hybrid Renewable Energy Station (HRES), founded by Ali Hellany and Tosin Famakinwa, resulting from several years of work established a Living Lab used for Learning and Teaching (L&T) and Research activities. Since 2016, the station has grown from a few solar panels into a larger hybrid station.

The station is located in a fenced space in the Werrington South campus and is connected to the main power in the Bxb shed and includes:

Solar PV panels: part of them are mounted on individual chassis that will allow the change of direction and angle of inclination, and the other part is mounted on a chassis that will allow the change
Wind Turbine that is fixed at a high pole and a concrete slab
A trailer that contains various inverters, switches, and batteries
An underground power and data cable between the trailer and the Bxb shed
Meter and switchboard in Bxb
Room with two computers and various monitoring equipment in Bxb
General area in the Shed to load the system with various electrical loads for research and teaching purposes
Space to store various PV and electrical equipment
The entire space is fenced, which is necessary to maintain the WH&S requirement and prevent tampering with the system.
Utilisation
The HRES station is utilised by approximately 62 interested groups including:

Academic researchers (electrical group)
HDR students (PhD and Meng students)
Final-year project students
Undergraduate students
Purpose and benefits
The HRES station has multiple uses including:

Living lab for research and testing for academics and researchers
Lab for final year students to practice their projects
Lab and demonstration for students enrolled in related subjects
Feeding the university grid with free energy
Links
The HRES station is linked to the following projects which are supervised by Ali Hellany and Tosin Famakinwa (School of Engineering) :

Sustainable House project. This project is mainly run by volunteer students who have installed a model house in the Kingswood campus near Building R.
IoT and power management of buildings, where the IoT system developed for the HRES project and Sustainable House will be included in the BMS box.
Future plans
The HRES installation will move to the Kingswood campus near Building R during 2024.

### IoT and BIM
Library at Kingswood campus

The Internet of Things (IoT) and Building Information Modelling (BIM) are being integrated with Digital Twin technologies to optimise energy consumption and indoor environmental parameters in the John Phillips Library, Kingswood campus.

The study is being undertaken by Centre for Smart Modern Construction (opens in new window)Opens in a new window to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13.

The study will capture live interactions, simulate data and use visualisation modelling tools like BIM to develop management procedures in the form of best practice guidelines.

These best practice guidelines will assist Library managers in optimising energy consumption and indoor environmental parameters.
